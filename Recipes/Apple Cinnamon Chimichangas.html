    <h3>Apple Cinnamon Chimichangas</h3>
    <p>The holidays are around the corner and with the holidays comes amazing food. 
    Though the food is always amazing, it can seem like we tend to cook the same dishes every
    year. Its about time we try a little something new. Today are gonna throw a mexican twist 
    to this classic desert.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1(21 ounce) can of apple pie filling</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cinnamon suga</li>
        <li>15(6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat apple pie filling in a small pot over medium-low heat until warmed through,
            about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Place cinnamon sugar in a shallow dish</li>
        <li>Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of filling onto each tortilla. Fold in opposing edges
            and roll up as youd would a burrito</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, deep saucepan over medium heat</li>
        <li>Place a batch of rolled tortillas seam-side down in the hot oil and fry until
            browned and crispy, 1 to 2 minute. Turn and continue frying until all sides are 
            browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Roll in cinnamon sugar to coat. Repeat with 
            remaining batches.</li>
